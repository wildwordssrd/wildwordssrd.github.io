            <h2 style="color: #fff; margin-bottom: -5;">SYSTEM SUMMARY</h2> 
            <h1 class="ph1" style="color: #fff;">THE WILDSEA</h1><br>
            <p class="pp">Here's a technical breakdown of the very first Wild Words game, The Wildsea.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Setting, Genre, and Tone</h3>
            <p class="pp"><b>Setting</b>: A world of endless forests, a treetop sea sailed by chainsaw ships.<br><b>Genre</b>: Vibrant Post-Apocalypse (the world has ended, but the new world is actually better for a lot of people in terms of opportunity and freedom), New Weird (unusual ways of living and uncanny creatures are the norm, traditional magic is sidelined in favour of weirdness)<br><b>Tone</b>: Bright Horror (terrible things happen, but there's always hope)</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">The Conversation</h3>
            <p class="pp">The player roles for the Wildsea follow the traditional TTRPG split, of GM and Players with Characters.The Firefly, the Wildsea's GM figure, provides story seeds and hooks, controls hazards and NPCs, and helps direct the shared story of the world. The Firefly helps to direct focus from player to player during the game, and may track specific actions and reactions that are taken during high-tension scenes such as combat or chases. Players: Each player has a character of their own, but they can also take a smaller share of the GM role from time to time based on doubles in dice results. Player actions are fiction-first, with the rules coming into play in response to their wants. Player characters have no mechanical death-state - death is a narrative event, though serious injury is entirely possible via mechanical means.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Scenes</h3>
            <p class="pp">Split into three distinct types, Scenes, Montages, and Journeys. Scenes cover normal actions and exploration, Montages allow characters to complete a single task, and Journeys have the crew interact with their shared asset (the ship) in order to move from place to place across the leafy sea using stricter, ritualized rules.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Tracks</h3>
            <p class="pp">Used to measure damage to characters and hazards, and set by the Firefly in order to track changes and developments within the world of the game. Tracks are flexible by nature, and multiple boxes can be marked thanks to impact and the interaction of damage and weaknesses/resistances.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Dice, Pools, and Rolls</h3>
            <p class="pp">Most dice pools are made from between 1 and 6 d6s, and are rolled to find a result that sits within one of three bands - Disaster (1-3), Conflict (4-5), and Triumph (6). There's an additional band, Twist (accessed by rolling doubles) that allows players to take the narrative reins for a moment and add an unexpected benefit to an action (though twists favour uninvolved players above the ones that are rolling). Difficulty (and other problems) are addressed by cutting results, rather than cutting dice, starting with the highest result. If all results would be cut, instead roll 1d6 and treat triumphs as conflicts.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Actions</h3>
            <p class="pp">These are freeform, and a single action has no specified length - it should allow a character to do something of note, as a guideline. When an action is Difficult, Dangerous, or Dramatic, the dice are rolled. Tasks are longer actions, reserved for montage-type scenes.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Backgrounds</h3>
            <p class="pp">Players choose three for their character, but may take elements from within any background - the chosen three are merely a guide.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Edges</h3>
            <p class="pp">There are seven edges, themed after the setting in terms of name. Using an edge as part of an action roll gives 1d6.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Skills</h3>
            <p class="pp">Skills are broken down into two categories, skills and languages Each skill directly affects certain kind of actions, but can also be interpreted loosely to give benefits in related situations (rewards clever thinking). Each langauge records fluency in a spoken tongue and information about the cuture behind that language. Skills and languages have three potential ranks, and give 1d6 for each rank when used to add to a roll.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Aspects</h3>
            <p class="pp">Combine tracks (for absorbing damage and using special rules), types (which affect how tracks are cleared), narrative elements (with name and description allowing thematic uses), and special rules (which override the usual rules of the wildsea) into packets of information contained within backgrounds. Characters choose multiple aspects at creation, and they can be developed and added to throughout play. aspects add a d6 if they're relevant to an action, even in name or description only.</p>
            <br>
          </div>
          <div class="page">
            <h3 class="ph3">Meters</h3>
            <p class="pp">Not used by the Wildsea core game.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Impulses</h3>
            <p class="pp">Split into Drives (which are positive) and Mirs (which are negative). Drives describe what a character strives for and satisfying or working towards drives can clear mire and add milestones (used for character progression). Mires represent the negative effects of a character losing faith in themselves or giving in to terror and cruelty. They each have a two-box track, which imposes narrative suggestions when one box is marked and cut-based mechanical requirements when both boxes are marked.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Resources</h3>
            <p class="pp">Split into four categories, Salvage, Specimens, Whispers, and Charts. Salvage is mostly used to build temporary gear, specimens to make food, drinks, and alchemical concoctions, whispers to change the world in small ways (the same way a twist can), and charts to aid with navigation and discovering new places during a journey. Resources can be used to add 1d6 to dice rolls for actions, but doing so risks the resource - if the roll goes well the resource remains, if it goe badly the resource is destroyed. Resources are also used for healing, and traded for other (more useful resources). They can have positive or negative tags that can make both of these activities easier or more difficult.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Wealth</h3>
            <p class="pp">Not used by the Wildsea core game - smaller non-resource interactions (such as buying drinks or food) si covered by the concept of Scratch, weird stuff kept in pockets that is always enough for basic, boring purposes.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Metacurrency</h3>
            <p class="pp">Milestones are earned during each sessions and aftetr the conclusion of large story arcs, named after the events that inspired them. Milestones are used to extend tracks, purchase new skills and languages, and combine, develop, or gain new aspects. Stakes, a metacurrency that you can trade cargo for, are used to create ships.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Creation Methods</h3>
            <p class="pp">Characters are made by making a number of choices at the beginning of a game, depending on the level of experience a Firefly and players want the characters to have. Ships are made by spending stakes, representing each characters contributions towards the ship.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Twists</h3>
            <p class="pp">Accessed by rolling doubles on dice or by using whispers during a scene. Decided by players uninvolved in the roll, confirmed by players that rolled and the Firefly.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Damage (and Resistance)</h3>
            <p class="pp">Multiple damage types are available, combined with ranges (CQ or LR) to make weapons for characters. Characters ahazards can have resistances, immunities, and weaknesses, but these are more impactful in terms of adding and removing marks when used by characters.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Impact</h3>
            <p class="pp">Marks made on tracks (and narrative effects) are governed by impact, either Low, Standard, High, or Massive.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Shared Assets</h3>
            <p class="pp">Characters are assumed to be part of a crew, and own a ship together. The ship is a shared asset, with track-based ratings, rooms, and weapons of its own, constructed by using stakes by all of the players at the table.</p>
            <h3 class="ph3">Hazards</h3>
            <p class="pp">Monsters, pirates, and elements of the environment. Hazards have names and descriptions, types, drives of their own, a presence entry (showing how they look, taste, smell etc), potential resources a character might get from besting them, aspects describing their special rules, and quirks that add optional aspects. Hazards are under the control of the Firefly by default, and act without rolling (prompting responses from targeted characters). Hazards don't have innate tracks, but Fireflies can either give them tracks for each of their aspects or use strategy tracks to measure the progress of a fight or encounter.</p>

                Advantage includes pieces of the environment, resources, aspects, favourable situations, and helpful assistance - usually 1d6 (2d6 for multiple advantages). Helping Hands: Two crewmembers working together on the same task choose which provides the edges, advantages, or skill ranks. Both are affected by any negatives that result.
            </p>
            <h4 class="ph4">Reading the Dice</h4>
            <p class="pp">
                Use the highest single die and note if you have doubles. Triples or above only count as doubles.
            </p>
            <h4 class="ph4">Action Roll Results</h4>
            <p class="pp">
                <b>6 - Triumph</b>: Complete success, no drawbacks. Mark or clear a box on a track.<br>
                <b>5, 4 - Conflict</b>: 5, 4 - Conflict: Success with a drawback. Usually marks or clears a box.<br>
                <b>3, 2, 1 - Disaster</b>: Failure and narrative complication or drawback. Usually doesn't mark/clear a box.<br>
                <b>Doubles - Twist</b>: Adds a small, potentially useful twist, suggested by any player. Firefly has final say.<br>
            </p>
            <h4 class="ph4">Cut</h4>
            <p class="pp">
                Removes results after the roll, starting with the highest.
                <b>Cut for Difficulty</b>: Firefly lets you know if a roll is particularly difficult.<br>
                <b>Cut for Precision</b>: Cut 1 result to aim at a location/part. Declare before roll.<br>
                <b>Cut for Impact</b>: Cut for extra Impact, increasing to the next tier. Declare intent before rolling.<br>
            </p>
            <h4 class="ph4">Impact</h4>
            <p class="pp">
                <b>Low</b>: Action is weaker/has less effect, marks less boxes, downgrades power.<br>
                <b>Normal</b>: Most actions. Marks one box.<br>
                <b>High</b>: More effect/power. Marks an extra box.<br>

                Narrative dictates the order.<br>
                <b>Hijacking Focus</b>: If you hijack a Player’s focus, they have to agree first. Focus always returns to whatever it was hijacked from when action is done.<br>
            </p><h4 class="ph4">Attacking and Damage</h4>
            <p class="pp">
                Players usually choose if they inflict damage (and on which track) or an effect. Sometimes it’s both. Attacks normally mark 1 track box. Increased Impact or a more effective Damage Type marks an extra box.
            </p><h4 class="ph4">Damage Types</h4>
            <p class="pp">
                <b>Blunt</b>: Crushing - stun and break<br>
